* Toveri

A minimal process ring buffer to supervise and rotate on processes. It's like a
process pool except that you don't keep hold of a process when you fetch one
from a buffer.

#+END_SRC

**** Get a process from a buffer

#+BEGIN_SRC
toveri:get(RingBufName) -> {ok, Pid} | {error, {empty, Pos}}

RingBufName = atom()
Pid = pid()
Pos = non_neg_integer()
#+END_SRC

**** Delete a supervised process ring buffer
